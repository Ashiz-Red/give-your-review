My Personal Review

I was going into this with low expectations since as any anime fan knows not all animated series carries well on to live adaptation.
I'm looking at you Dragon Ball. But fortunately that wasn't the case with this movie.
As well the next two movies after it. The action was top notch, the story was ok being it was base on the series but they made some changes to fit the two hour time frame. A
ll the actors portrayed their rolls beautifully, especially the one that played the key tile role Kenshin. So all and all this movie would not be a disappointment for anyone to watch. 
Including for those that had never watch the animated series.
